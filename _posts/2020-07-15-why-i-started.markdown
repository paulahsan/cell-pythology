There are many Biologists like me who are unwilling to learn few line of codes so that they can build their own small tools to *move a mountain[^1]*

In this blog I will try to show how a few lines of code could help a biologist making nice vizualizations or do computations with ease.

I will consider cell biology data and mostly use Python and Bash (Zsh) shell to perform exploratory analysis or vizualize them. Hence the name **Cell-Pythology**

My upcoming posts could be:
1. How to save gH2AX foci counting data and make a boxplot out of it
2. How to make dotplots with gH2AX foci data
