I"Œ<p>Immunostaining is one of the widely used methods by the cell biolgists to evaluate kinatics of 
DNA repair. A very common example of such technique could be staining gH2AX or RAD50 proteins in 
the nucleus and measure DNA repair kinetics.</p>

<p>For the sake of the discussion leltâ€™s assume there is a wild type cell line (WT) and a mutant 
cell line (MUT); the MUT is incapable of repair double strand break (DSB). We grow both of the 
cell lines in same condition and then expose them to ionizing radiation to induce DSB <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. 
Upon sensing the DSB, the cells will activate some pathways via some signaling so that the DSB 
is repaired and the genome become intact.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Histones are abundant proteins on the DNA, one of them is H2A, combinedly called H2AX. After 
sensing DSB these H2AX are phorphorylated at Serine-139 and then the H2AX are called phosphorylated 
H2AX or Î³H2AX. Presence of Î³H2AX are the marker for unrepaired DSB. These proteins are fixed 
<em>in situ</em> and tagged with fluorescent antibody. Afterwards they can be easily visualized via 
microscopy. Generally they appear as small spots and are called Î³H2AX foci.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Letâ€™s get back to our experiment. Because the MUT cell line will fail to repair DSB, the Î³H2AX 
foci around DSB sites will be consistently high. On the other hand, for the WT cell line, 
initially the Î³H2AX foci count will be high and eventually will reduce, as the DNA is repaired.
For instance, if we collect samples 30 minutes, 1 hr and 2 hr after exoposing IR, for the WT 
cells foci count at 30 minutes will be highest which will gradually return to normal level by
1 hr and 2 hr.</p>

<p>In this blog we will discuss the following things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>How to save the data.</li>
  <li>How to vizualize them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Historically cell biologists utilize spreadsheets i.e MS Excel or any similar apps and record 
the data. I and some of my colleagues use the following pattern to recod the data.</p>

<p>Each of the columns are representing experiemntal condition and each of the rows are indicating
 the respective foci numbers in a sigle cell. This format is often refrred to as wide form of 
 data. Generally, this types of experiments enlist 50 of such observations. 
Three replicates are done of the experiments and then consecutive statistical analyses are
done. This will be discussed in a near future blog. However, there are substantial drawbacks 
with this formating:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First of all this is not a <em>tidy data</em>.</li>
  <li>This format is problematic to handle.</li>
</ol>

<p>Before showing the right format we will actually show how to convert this format to a <em>tidy 
format</em>.</p>
