I"Ê<p>There are many Biologists like me who are unwilling to learn few line of codes so that they can build their own small tools to <em>move a mountain<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></em></p>

<p>In this blog I will try to show how a few lines of code could help a biologist making nice vizualizations or do computations with ease.</p>

<p>I will consider cell biology data and mostly use Python and Bash (Zsh) shell to perform exploratory analysis or vizualize them. Hence the name <strong>Cell-Pythology</strong></p>
